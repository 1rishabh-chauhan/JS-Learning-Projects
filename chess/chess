i have been tring to make this game from 3 days , only thing i realized is thre is no point copying nd pasting the whole code from some tutorial unti l you have some more grip of  whats about to come if not the whole thing , so i have decided to put this snippet on hold 

i think i will continue to learn rect , now some may ask why not continue js vanilla, which is  a reasonable question to be honest but i think i have taken way to long on jss and time is of the essesnce for me and also m looking for the chenge may be that will help speeden up the process more update may follow
